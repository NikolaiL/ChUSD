Pika chUSD is gamified stablecoin Base miniapp that uses ETH as collateral to mint chUSD stablecoin. The collateral ratio of ETH determines Pikachu's mood, which changes based on the health factor of ETH/chUSD. As a user, you should be responsible for keeping Pikachu happy, unless you want your Pikachu to get sad and you will get liquidated. If the collateral ratio drops, it will negatively affect Pikachu's mood and expose you to liquidation risk. The app itself have 5 moods of emotions of Pikachi's character which changes based on the collateral ratio. 


## How it works 🎢
- 📥 After depositing ETH, the user will receive chUSD and the game will display the default state of Pikachu's mood
- 🐥 Pikatchu's mood changes based on the price of ETH as collateral 
- 🧑‍💻 As user you are responsible for keeping Pikachu in a happy mood and avoiding liquidation of your collateral 
- 🕹 The game itself has five stages of Pikachu's happiness based on the liquidation risk of your collateral

# Bounties 🤓
🛑 RedStone 
We are using RedStone stack for BaseETH price feed changes between BaseETH and chUSD to reflect changes of the Pikachu character
🟦Base 
We are using BaseETH as collateral for the game and deployed the game as Base miniapp 
🏗BuidlGuidl

# Next steps 💼
We are planning to enable user to earn yield on chUSD stablecoin as well enable notifications when the price changes to avoid user to get REKT (liquidated)
